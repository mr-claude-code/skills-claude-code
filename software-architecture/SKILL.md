## PILLAR 1: FUNDAMENTALS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

### Clean Code & Best Practices

**Meaningful Naming:**
- Variables, functions, classes must reveal intent
- Avoid abbreviations, single letters (except loop counters), and cryptic names
- Boolean variables: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit` (prefix with is/has/can)
- Functions: verb + noun (`calculateTotal`, `fetchUser`, `validateEmail`)
- Classes: nouns describing the entity (`UserRepository`, `PaymentService`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`)

**Small Functions with Single Responsibility:**
- Each function does ONE thing well
- Maximum 20-30 lines (ideally under 15)
- Maximum 3 parameters (use object parameter for more)
- Extract helper functions when logic gets complex
- Name clearly describes what the function does

**Pure Functions & Side Effect Minimization:**
- Same input = same output, no external state mutation
- Isolate side effects (I/O, DB, API calls) at the edges
- Core business logic should be pure and testable
- Use dependency injection to push side effects outward

**Cyclomatic Complexity Reduction:**
- Maximum 10 paths per function (ideally under 5)
- Use early returns to flatten nested conditions
- Replace switch/case with strategy pattern or lookup maps
- Extract complex conditionals into named boolean variables
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)

**Separation of Business Logic from Framework:**
- Business rules must NEVER depend on framework code
- Framework is a detail, not the architecture
- Business logic should be portable between frameworks
- Use adapters/ports to isolate framework dependencies

**Continuous Refactoring:**
- Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it
- Refactor in small, safe steps with tests as safety net
- Address code smells immediately, don't let tech debt accumulate
- Refactoring is not rewriting - preserve behavior while improving structure

### Programming Paradigms

**Structured Programming:**
- Sequential execution with control structures (if/else, loops, switch)
- Functions and procedures as organizational units
- Top-down decomposition of problems
- Appropriate for: scripts, automations, linear processing pipelines

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
- Encapsulation: data and behaviors united in classes, hide internal state
- Inheritance: reuse through hierarchies (use with GREAT caution, prefer composition)
- Polymorphism: same interface, multiple implementations
- Abstraction: hide complexity, expose only what's necessary
- Apply when: modeling complex domains, enterprise systems, stateful entities

**Functional Programming:**
- Immutability: data is never altered, only transformed
- Pure functions: same input = same output, no side effects
- Composition: small functions combined to create complex behaviors
- Higher-order functions: functions that receive/return functions
- Currying and partial application for reusable logic
- Apply when: data transformation, pipelines, pure domain logic, React components

## PILLAR 2: DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### SOLID Principles (Mandatory Application)

```
S - Single Responsibility Principle
    Each module/class has ONE single reason to change
    VIOLATION: UserService that authenticates, sends email and generates report
    CORRECT: AuthService, EmailService, ReportService separated

O - Open/Closed Principle
    Open for extension, closed for modification
    VIOLATION: giant switch/case that needs to be edited for each new type
    CORRECT: Strategy pattern or polymorphism for new behaviors

L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
    VIOLATION: Square extends Rectangle but breaks when setting width/height
    CORRECT: Segregated interfaces or composition

I - Interface Segregation Principle
    Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
    VIOLATION: IWorker interface with work() and eat() - robots don't eat
    CORRECT: IWorkable and IFeedable separated

D - Dependency Inversion Principle
    Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
    VIOLATION: OrderService instantiates MySQLRepository directly
    CORRECT: OrderService receives IOrderRepository via injection
```

### Essential Design Principles

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation
- Duplication of LOGIC is forbidden (copying validation code)
- Duplication of DATA is acceptable when necessary (denormalization)
- BUT: don't over-DRY - premature abstraction is worse than duplication

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
- The simplest solution that solves the problem is the correct one
- Complexity is only added when NECESSARY, not by anticipation
- Code cleverness is an antipattern - clarity always wins

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
- DO NOT implement features "for the future"
- DO NOT create abstractions for "flexibility" without real need
- Cost of maintaining unused code > cost of implementing later

**Composition over Inheritance:**
- Prefer composing objects via interfaces over class hierarchies
- Inheritance creates tight coupling and fragile base classes
- Composition enables flexible behavior mixing at runtime
- Use inheritance only for true "is-a" relationships (rare)
- In React: use hooks and composition, never inheritance

**Command Query Separation (CQS):**
- Commands: change state, return nothing (void)
- Queries: return data, change nothing (no side effects)
- A method should either command or query, NEVER both
- Exception: stack.pop() - but document the exception clearly

**Law of Demeter (Tell, Don't Ask):**
- An object should only talk to its immediate friends
- VIOLATION: `order.getCustomer().getAddress().getCity()` (train wreck)
- CORRECT: `order.getDeliveryCity()` - encapsulate the traversal
- Reduces coupling, improves encapsulation
- Each unit should have limited knowledge of other units

**Fail-Fast Design:**
- Detect and report errors as early as possible
- Validate inputs at system boundaries immediately
- Throw exceptions rather than propagating invalid state
- Use assertions for programming errors (invariants)
- Fail loudly in development, gracefully in production

**Hollywood Principle ("Don't call us, we'll call you"):**
- High-level modules define the flow, low-level modules plug in
- Framework calls your code, not the other way around
- Foundation of IoC containers and plugin architectures
- Event-driven systems naturally follow this principle

**GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns):**
```
Information Expert: assign responsibility to the class that has the data
Creator: assign creation to the class that has the initializing data
Controller: assign system events to a non-UI class (use case handler)
Low Coupling: minimize dependencies between classes
High Cohesion: keep related responsibilities together
Polymorphism: use polymorphism to handle type-based variations
Indirection: add intermediate objects to reduce direct coupling
Pure Fabrication: create service classes that don't represent domain concepts
Protected Variations: wrap instability behind stable interfaces
```

---

## PILLAR 3: DESIGN PATTERNS

### GoF Patterns

**Creational:**
- Factory Method: create objects without specifying concrete class
- Abstract Factory: families of related objects
- Builder: step-by-step construction of complex objects
- Singleton: single instance (use with GREAT caution - global state)
- Prototype: clone existing objects

**Structural:**
- Adapter: make incompatible interfaces compatible
- Bridge: separate abstraction from implementation
- Composite: treat individual and composite objects uniformly
- Decorator: add responsibilities dynamically
- Facade: simplified interface for complex subsystem
- Proxy: substitute/placeholder to control access
- Flyweight: share common state between objects to save memory

**Behavioral:**
- Strategy: family of interchangeable algorithms
- Observer: notification of state changes
- Command: encapsulate request as object (undo/redo, queuing)
- State: alter behavior based on state
- Template Method: algorithm skeleton with customizable steps
- Mediator: reduce chaotic dependencies via central coordinator
- Chain of Responsibility: pass requests along a chain of handlers
- Iterator: traverse collections without exposing internals
- Visitor: add operations to objects without changing their classes
- Memento: capture and restore object state (snapshots)

### Application Patterns

**Repository Pattern:**
- Abstraction layer between domain and data persistence
- Domain works with collections-like interface, not DB queries
- Enables swapping persistence mechanisms without domain changes
- Use for: any entity that needs persistence

**Unit of Work:**
- Track all changes in a business transaction
- Commit or rollback all changes atomically
- Coordinate writes across multiple repositories
- Use for: complex operations spanning multiple aggregates

**Specification Pattern:**
- Encapsulate business rules as composable objects
- Combine with AND, OR, NOT operators
- Use for: complex filtering, validation rules, query criteria

**Value Objects:**
- Immutable objects defined by their attributes, not identity
- Override equality by value (not reference)
- Examples: Money, Email, Address, DateRange
- Use for: any concept where identity doesn't matter, only value

**DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**
- Simple objects for data transfer between layers/systems
- No business logic, only data
- Separate from domain entities - never expose domain entities directly
- Transform at boundaries: Entity <-> DTO

**Use Cases / Interactors:**
- One class per use case (application service)
- Orchestrate domain objects to fulfill a specific business operation
- Single entry point, clear input/output
- Use for: every application operation (CreateOrder, ProcessPayment, etc.)

**REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response):**
- Each API endpoint has its own Request, Handler, and Response types
- No shared DTOs between endpoints
- Minimal coupling between endpoints
- Use for: API design in vertical slice architectures

---

## PILLAR 4: ARCHITECTURAL STYLES & PATTERNS

### Fundamental Architectures

**Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob):**
```
Layers from outside to inside:
[Frameworks/Drivers] -> [Interface Adapters] -> [Use Cases] -> [Entities]

- Entities: enterprise business rules, independent of everything
- Use Cases: specific application rules, orchestrate entities
- Interface Adapters: data conversion between formats
- Frameworks: technical details (DB, Web, UI)

DEPENDENCY RULE: dependencies point only INWARD
Inner layers NEVER know about outer layers
```

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):**
```
        [Primary Adapter: REST API, CLI, GraphQL]
                       |
                       v
[Adapter] -> [PORT] -> [DOMAIN] <- [PORT] <- [Adapter]
                       ^
                       |
        [Secondary Adapter: DB, Queue, Email]

- Domain: pure business logic, no external dependencies
- Ports: interfaces that the domain exposes/requires
- Primary Ports: driven by external actors (incoming)
- Secondary Ports: domain drives external systems (outgoing)
- Adapters: concrete implementations of ports
```

**Onion Architecture:**
```
Concentric layers:
[Infrastructure] -> [Application Services] -> [Domain Services] -> [Domain Model]

- Domain Model: entities and value objects at the center
- Domain Services: logic that doesn't belong to a single entity
- Application Services: orchestration, use cases
- Infrastructure: persistence, external APIs, UI
```

**Vertical Slice Architecture:**
```
Instead of horizontal layers, organize by FEATURE:

Feature A: [API -> Handler -> DB]
Feature B: [API -> Handler -> DB]
Feature C: [API -> Handler -> DB]

- Each slice is independent and self-contained
- Changes to one feature don't affect others
- Mix patterns per slice (simple CRUD vs complex DDD)
- IDEAL for: MVPs, rapid iteration, reducing coupling
- Combine with: CQRS, MediatR, feature folders
```

**Layered / N-Tier Architecture:**
```
[Presentation Layer]
        |
[Business Logic Layer]
        |
[Data Access Layer]
        |
[Database]

- Simple, well-understood pattern
- Each layer only communicates with adjacent layers
- Good starting point for most applications
- Risk: becomes coupled if layers leak abstractions
```

**MVC / MVVM:**
```
MVC (Model-View-Controller):
- Model: data and business logic
- View: presentation/UI
- Controller: handles input, updates model, selects view
- Use for: server-rendered web apps, traditional backends

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
- Model: data and business logic
- View: UI (declarative binding)
- ViewModel: state + logic for the view
- Use for: React (hooks as ViewModel), mobile apps, SPAs
```

### Distributed Architectures

**Modular Monolith:**
```
Single deployment unit, BUT internally modular:

[Module A] [Module B] [Module C]
     \         |         /
      [Shared Kernel]
           |
      [Single DB]

- Modules communicate via well-defined interfaces (not direct DB access)
- Each module owns its domain and data
- Can extract to microservices later if needed
- BEST STARTING POINT for MVPs and SaaS

Benefits over pure monolith:
- Clear boundaries and encapsulation
- Easier to reason about and test
- Natural migration path to microservices
```

**Microservices:**
```
- Independent services per bounded context
- Database per service (mandatory)
- Communication via network (sync/async)

Advantages:
- Granular scalability, independent deploy
- Autonomous teams per service
- Heterogeneous technology possible

Disadvantages:
- MUCH greater operational complexity
- Distributed debugging is difficult
- Eventual consistency (CAP theorem)
- Network overhead and latency

USE WHEN: Real scale needed, large teams, complex domains
NEVER START WITH MICROSERVICES - extract from mature monolith/modular monolith
```

**Service Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
```
- Enterprise-level service organization
- Services communicate via ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)
- Heavier than microservices, more governance
- Use when: large enterprise integration, legacy modernization
```

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
```
Patterns:
- Event Notification: notify that something happened
- Event-Carried State Transfer: event contains all data needed
- Event Sourcing: persist events as source of truth, derive state
- CQRS: separate read/write models

Advantages:
- Temporal and spatial decoupling
- Natural scalability, audit and replay
- Loose coupling between components

Disadvantages:
- Eventual consistency mandatory
- More complex debugging, event ordering is challenging
```

**Serverless Architecture:**
```
- Functions as a Service (FaaS): AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers
- Backend as a Service (BaaS): Firebase, Supabase, Neon
- Zero infrastructure management
- Auto-scaling from zero to massive

Advantages:
- No server management, pay-per-execution
- Infinite scalability, fast time to market
- IDEAL for MVPs and Micro-SaaS

Disadvantages:
- Cold start latency
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited execution time and memory
- Complex local development/testing

Use for: APIs, webhooks, scheduled jobs, data processing
```

**BFF (Backend for Frontend):**
```
[Web App] -> [BFF Web] ----\
[Mobile]  -> [BFF Mobile] ---> [Microservices]
[Admin]   -> [BFF Admin] ---/

- Dedicated backend per frontend type
- Each BFF tailored to its client's needs
- Aggregates calls to downstream services
- Use when: multiple clients with different data needs
```

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

```
STRATEGIC DDD:

Ubiquitous Language:
- Shared vocabulary between devs and domain experts
- Code uses the SAME terms as the business
- No translation layer - if business says "Order", code has Order class

Bounded Contexts:
- Explicit boundaries where a model applies
- Same term can mean different things in different contexts
- "Product" in Catalog vs "Product" in Shipping = different models
- Each context has its own model, its own database (ideally)

Context Mapping:
- Shared Kernel: two contexts share a subset
- Customer/Supplier: upstream provides, downstream consumes
- Conformist: downstream conforms to upstream model
- Anti-Corruption Layer: translates between contexts
- Open Host Service: well-defined protocol for integration
- Published Language: shared schema (JSON Schema, Protobuf)

TACTICAL DDD:

Entities:
- Objects with identity that persists through state changes
- Equality by ID, not by attributes
- Example: User, Order, Product

Value Objects:
- Immutable, equality by value
- No identity - defined entirely by attributes
- Example: Money(100, "BRL"), Email("user@test.com"), Address

Aggregates:
- Cluster of entities and value objects with consistency boundary
- One entity is the Aggregate Root (entry point)
- External references only to the root, never internal entities
- Transactions align with aggregate boundaries
- Keep aggregates SMALL

Domain Events:
- Something meaningful that happened in the domain
- Named in past tense: OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed, UserRegistered
- Immutable records of facts
- Enable loose coupling between bounded contexts

Domain Services:
- Logic that doesn't naturally belong to any entity
- Stateless operations involving multiple entities
- Example: PricingService, TransferService

Repositories:
- Persistence abstraction for aggregates
- One repository per aggregate root
- Collection-like interface (find, save, delete)

Factories:
- Complex aggregate creation logic
- Ensure aggregates are created in valid state
```

### Architectural Patterns

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
```
[Commands] -> [Write Model] -> [Write DB]
                                    |
                              [Projection/Sync]
                                    |
[Queries]  -> [Read Model]  -> [Read DB]

- Separate models optimized for read and write
- Write model: normalized, consistent, domain-rich
- Read model: denormalized, fast, query-optimized
- Can use different databases for each side
- Use for: systems with high read/write ratio disparity, complex domains
- Combine with: Event Sourcing, Domain Events
```

**Event Sourcing:**
```
Traditional: Store current STATE in database
Event Sourcing: Store EVENTS that led to current state

Events: [OrderCreated] -> [ItemAdded] -> [ItemAdded] -> [OrderPaid]
State:  Replay events to derive current state

Advantages:
- Complete audit trail
- Time travel (rebuild state at any point)
- Event replay for projections and analytics
- Natural fit with CQRS

Disadvantages:
- Eventual consistency
- Event schema evolution is complex
- Storage grows indefinitely (need snapshots)

Use for: financial systems, audit-critical domains, complex state machines
```

**Saga Pattern:**
```
Distributed transactions across services without 2PC:

Choreography (event-based):
[Service A] -event-> [Service B] -event-> [Service C]
Each service listens and reacts, publishes compensating events on failure

Orchestration (coordinator-based):
[Saga Orchestrator] -> [Service A]
                    -> [Service B]
                    -> [Service C]
Central coordinator manages the flow and compensations

Use Choreography when: few steps, simple flow
Use Orchestration when: many steps, complex flow, visibility needed
```

**Outbox / Inbox Pattern:**
```
Problem: ensure event publishing + DB write are atomic

Outbox Pattern:
1. Write entity + event to SAME database (same transaction)
2. Background process reads outbox table and publishes events
3. Mark events as published

Inbox Pattern:
1. Consumer writes received event to inbox table
2. Process inbox idempotently
3. Prevents duplicate processing

Use for: reliable event publishing in distributed systems
```

---

## PILLAR 5: SYSTEM DESIGN & SCALABILITY

### Core Concepts

**CAP Theorem:**
```
In a distributed system, you can only guarantee 2 of 3:

C - Consistency: every read receives the most recent write
A - Availability: every request receives a response
P - Partition Tolerance: system works despite network failures

In practice, P is non-negotiable, so you choose:
- CP: Consistency + Partition Tolerance (banking, inventory)
  Examples: MongoDB, Redis, HBase
- AP: Availability + Partition Tolerance (social media, caching)
  Examples: Cassandra, CouchDB, DynamoDB

PACELC Extension:
If Partition -> choose A or C
Else (normal operation) -> choose Latency or Consistency
```

**Consistency Patterns:**
```
Strong Consistency:
- All nodes see the same data at the same time
- Higher latency, lower throughput
- Use for: financial transactions, inventory

Eventual Consistency:
- All nodes will eventually converge to same state
- Lower latency, higher throughput
- Use for: social feeds, analytics, notifications

Read-Your-Writes Consistency:
- User always sees their own writes
- Others may see stale data temporarily
- Good compromise for user-facing applications
```

**Availability Patterns:**
```
99.9% (Three Nines): ~8.7 hours downtime/year
99.99% (Four Nines): ~52 minutes downtime/year
99.999% (Five Nines): ~5 minutes downtime/year

Strategies:
- Active-Passive Failover: standby takes over on failure
- Active-Active: multiple nodes handle traffic simultaneously
- Multi-Region: deploy across geographic regions
- Health checks + Auto-healing
```

**Performance Metrics:**
```
Latency: time to process a single request (p50, p95, p99)
Throughput: number of requests processed per time unit
Scalability: ability to handle increased load
Bandwidth: maximum data transfer rate

Scalability Types:
- Vertical (Scale Up): more CPU/RAM (limited, requires downtime)
- Horizontal (Scale Out): more instances (unlimited, needs stateless)
PREFER HORIZONTAL - design for scale out from day one
```

### System Components

**Load Balancers:**
```
Layer 4 (Transport):
- Routes based on IP and port
- Faster, less flexible
- Cannot inspect HTTP headers/content
- Use for: TCP/UDP traffic, raw performance

Layer 7 (Application):
- Routes based on HTTP headers, URL, cookies
- Can do SSL termination, compression, caching
- Content-based routing
- Use for: HTTP traffic, path-based routing, A/B testing

Algorithms:
- Round Robin: sequential distribution
- Least Connections: send to least busy server
- IP Hash: same client always on same server (sticky sessions)
- Weighted: servers with different capacities
- Least Response Time: fastest server gets next request

Tools: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ALB/NLB, Cloudflare
```

**CDN (Content Delivery Networks):**
```
- Cache static content at edge locations worldwide
- Reduce latency for geographically distributed users
- Offload origin server traffic
- DDoS protection at the edge

Cache Strategy:
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images): long TTL, cache-bust with hashes
- API responses: short TTL or no cache
- HTML pages: varies (SSG = cache, SSR = no cache or short TTL)

Providers: Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Vercel Edge, Fastly
```

**DNS & Reverse Proxy:**
```
DNS:
- Domain name resolution
- DNS-based load balancing (round robin, geolocation)
- TTL management for failover
- Use Route53, Cloudflare DNS

Reverse Proxy:
- Sits between client and servers
- SSL termination, compression, caching
- Request routing, rate limiting
- Hide internal infrastructure
- Tools: NGINX, Traefik, Caddy
```

**Caching Strategies:**
```
Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):
- App checks cache first, on miss fetches from DB and populates cache
- Most common pattern, simple to implement
- Risk: cache stampede on cold cache

Read-Through:
- Cache itself fetches from DB on miss
- Simpler app code, cache manages loading

Write-Through:
- Write to cache AND DB synchronously
- Consistent but slower writes

Write-Behind (Write-Back):
- Write to cache, async write to DB
- Fast writes, risk of data loss

Cache Invalidation Strategies:
- TTL (Time To Live): simplest, eventually consistent
- Event-based: invalidate on write events
- Version-based: cache key includes version number

Tools: Redis, Memcached, Vercel KV, Upstash
```

**Message Queues & Event Streaming:**
```
RabbitMQ:
- Traditional broker with AMQP
- Exchanges, Queues, Bindings
- Strong delivery guarantees
- Use for: task queues, RPC, simple pub/sub

Apache Kafka:
- Distributed log, not traditional queue
- Configurable message retention
- Consumer groups for parallelism
- Use for: event streaming, data pipelines, event sourcing

NATS:
- Lightweight, high-performance
- Simple pub/sub and request/reply
- JetStream for persistence
- Use for: microservices communication, IoT

Amazon SQS:
- Managed serverless queue
- Standard (at-least-once) vs FIFO (exactly-once)
- Use for: simple decoupling in AWS

BullMQ (Node.js):
- Redis-based queue for Node.js
- Job scheduling, retries, priorities
- Use for: background jobs in Node.js/Next.js apps
```

**Databases:**
```
SQL (Relational):
- Rigid schema, ACID transactions
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Use for: structured data, financial, referential integrity
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, PlanetScale, Neon

NoSQL Document (MongoDB, Firestore):
- Flexible JSON documents
- Use for: product catalogs, CMS, user profiles

Key-Value (Redis, DynamoDB):
- Access by key, extremely fast
- Use for: cache, sessions, rate limiting

Column-Family (Cassandra, ScyllaDB):
- Optimized for massive writes
- Use for: time-series, IoT, analytics

Graph (Neo4j, Neptune):
- Nodes and edges as first-class citizens
- Use for: social networks, recommendations, fraud detection

Scaling Strategies:
- Replication: primary-replica for read scaling
- Sharding: horizontal partitioning across servers
- Federation: split by function (users DB, orders DB)
- Denormalization: duplicate data for read performance
```

**API Styles:**
```
REST:
- Stateless, resources via URLs
- HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Simple, widely supported, cacheable
- Use for: public APIs, simple CRUD, general purpose

GraphQL:
- Client defines response shape
- Single endpoint, no over/under fetching
- Subscriptions for real-time
- Use for: complex frontends, mobile (bandwidth), BFF

gRPC:

- Server-to-client one-directional stream
- Simpler than WebSockets for one-way data
- Use for: notifications, live feeds, AI streaming responses

tRPC:
- End-to-end type safety between client and server
- No schema generation or code gen needed
- Use for: TypeScript full-stack apps, Next.js
```

**Service Discovery & Service Mesh:**
```
Service Discovery:
- Services find each other dynamically
- Registry: Consul, etcd, Eureka
- DNS-based: Kubernetes DNS
- Client-side vs Server-side discovery

Service Mesh:
- Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication
- Handles: mTLS, load balancing, observability, retries
- Sidecar proxy pattern (Envoy)
- Tools: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
- Use when: many microservices need consistent cross-cutting concerns
```

### Cloud Design Patterns

```
Resilience Patterns:
- Circuit Breaker: prevent cascade failures (Closed -> Open -> Half-Open)
- Bulkhead: isolate resources per component (separate thread/connection pools)
- Retry with Exponential Backoff: retry with increasing wait + jitter
- Timeout: ALWAYS define timeouts on external calls
- Throttling/Rate Limiting: protect services from overload

Migration Patterns:
- Strangler Fig: incrementally replace legacy system piece by piece
- Anti-Corruption Layer: translate between old and new models
- Branch by Abstraction: switch implementations behind interface

Structural Patterns:
- Ambassador: offload cross-cutting concerns to proxy
- Sidecar: deploy helper components alongside main service
- Gateway Aggregation: aggregate multiple service calls into one
- Gateway Routing: route requests to appropriate services

Data Patterns:
- Outbox: reliable event publishing with DB transaction
- Inbox: idempotent event consumption

## PILLAR 6: DEVOPS & CLOUD

### Containers

```
Docker:
- Package application with all dependencies
- Consistent environment across dev/staging/production
- Dockerfile: declarative image definition
- Multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Best practices:
  - Use specific base image versions (not :latest)
  - Minimize layers, use .dockerignore
  - Run as non-root user
  - Scan for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk)

Docker Compose:
- Define multi-container applications
- Local development environment
- Service dependencies and networking
- Use for: local dev with DB, Redis, queues
```

### Orchestration

```
Kubernetes (K8s):
- Container orchestration at scale
- Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets
- Auto-scaling (HPA), self-healing, rolling updates
- Helm charts for package management
- Use when: multiple services, need auto-scaling, production-grade

Simpler Alternatives:
- Docker Compose + Swarm: small-scale deployments
- Railway, Render, Fly.io: managed container platforms
- Vercel/Netlify: serverless for Next.js/React
- AWS ECS/Fargate: managed containers on AWS

RULE: Don't use K8s for a single service. Match orchestration to complexity.
```

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

```
Terraform:
- Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Declarative HCL language
- State management, plan before apply
- Modules for reusable infrastructure

Pulumi:
- IaC using real programming languages (TS, Python, Go)
- Better type safety and IDE support
- Use when: team prefers TypeScript over HCL

SST (Serverless Stack):
- IaC for serverless on AWS
- Built for Next.js, Remix, Astro
- Live Lambda Development
- Use for: serverless full-stack apps

RULE: ALL infrastructure must be in code. No manual console clicks in production.
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

```
Pipeline Stages:
1. Lint & Format: ESLint, Prettier, Biome
2. Type Check: tsc --noEmit
3. Unit Tests: fast, isolated
4. Build: compile and bundle
5. Integration Tests: with real dependencies
6. Security Scan: dependency vulnerabilities
7. Deploy to Staging: automatic
8. E2E Tests: against staging
9. Deploy to Production: manual gate or auto

Tools:
- GitHub Actions: most common for GitHub repos
- GitLab CI: built into GitLab
- CircleCI, Jenkins: enterprise
- Vercel/Netlify: auto-deploy on push

Best Practices:
- Fast feedback: lint + unit tests < 5 minutes
- Branch protection: require passing CI for merge
- Trunk-based development: short-lived feature branches
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
```

### Monitoring & Observability

```
Three Pillars of Observability:

1. Logging:
   - Structured logs (JSON format)
   - Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
   - Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Tools: Pino, Winston + ELK Stack, Loki, Datadog

2. Metrics:
   - Request rate, error rate, latency (RED method)
   - Saturation: CPU, memory, disk, connections
   - Business metrics: signups, conversions, revenue
   - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic

3. Distributed Tracing:
   - Follow a request across services
   - Identify bottlenecks and slow dependencies
   - Tools: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog APT

Alerting:
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Actionable alerts only (no noise)
- Escalation policies and on-call rotation
- Tools: PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana Alerting

Health Checks:
- Liveness: is the process alive?
- Readiness: can the service handle traffic?
- Startup: has the service finished initializing?
```

## PILLAR 7: SECURITY & RESILIENCE

### Authentication & Authorization

```
OAuth 2.0:
- Authorization framework for third-party access
- Grant types: Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Device Code
- Access tokens (short-lived) + Refresh tokens (long-lived)
- PKCE extension for public clients (SPAs, mobile)

OpenID Connect (OIDC):
- Identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0
- ID token (JWT) with user identity claims
- Standard scopes: openid, profile, email
- Use for: "Login with Google/GitHub/etc."

JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
- Stateless authentication tokens
- Header.Payload.Signature
- NEVER store secrets in JWT payload (it's base64, not encrypted)
- Short expiration + refresh token rotation
- Verify signature server-side, validate claims (exp, iss, aud)

Session-Based Auth:
- Server stores session state
- Cookie with session ID
- Use for: traditional web apps, when you need server-side revocation

Auth Providers (recommended for MVPs):
- Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth, NextAuth.js/Auth.js
- DON'T build auth from scratch unless you have specific requirements
```

### API Security

```
Best Practices:
- HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- Input validation and sanitization (Zod, Joi)
- CORS configuration (whitelist specific origins)
- Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries, ORMs)
- XSS prevention (Content Security Policy, output encoding)
- CSRF protection (SameSite cookies, CSRF tokens)

API Authentication:
- API Keys: simple, for server-to-server
- Bearer tokens (JWT): for user authentication
- OAuth 2.0: for third-party integrations
- HMAC signatures: for webhooks verification

Secrets Management:
- NEVER commit secrets to code
- Environment variables for configuration
- Key Vault / Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Tools: AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, Doppler, Infisical
```

### Idempotency

```
Definition: same operation applied multiple times = same result

Critical for:
- Payment processing (charge exactly once)
- API retries (network failures)
- Event handlers (at-least-once delivery)

Implementation Strategies:
- Idempotency key: client sends unique key per request
- Database unique constraints: prevent duplicate writes
- Conditional updates: UPDATE WHERE version = X
- Inbox pattern: track processed event IDs

HTTP Methods:
- GET, PUT, DELETE: naturally idempotent
- POST: NOT idempotent - needs explicit idempotency mechanism
```

### Distributed Systems Safety

```
Distributed Locking:
- Prevent concurrent access to shared resources
- Redis-based locks (Redlock algorithm)
- Database advisory locks
- Lease-based locks with TTL (prevent deadlocks)
- Use sparingly - prefer idempotent designs

Distributed Transactions:
- 2PC (Two-Phase Commit): coordinator-based, blocking (avoid when possible)
- Saga Pattern: compensating transactions (preferred)
- Outbox Pattern: reliable event publishing
- Eventual consistency: embrace it, don't fight it

High Availability Patterns:
- No single point of failure
- Graceful degradation: serve partial functionality when components fail
- Chaos engineering: intentionally break things to find weaknesses
- Circuit breaker + fallback: return cached/default data on failure
```

## PILLAR 8: QUALITY, TESTING & MODELING

### Testing Strategy

```
Test Pyramid:
         /  E2E  \        <- Few, slow, expensive
        / Integration \    <- Moderate amount
       /    Unit Tests  \  <- Many, fast, cheap

Unit Tests:
- Test a single unit in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- FAST (< 1ms per test)
- Use for: business logic, utility functions, domain models

Integration Tests:
- Test interaction between components
- Real database, real API calls (test containers)
- Moderate speed (< 5s per test)
- Use for: repositories, API endpoints, middleware

End-to-End Tests:
- Test complete user flows
- Real browser, real backend
- Slow but high confidence
- Use for: critical paths (signup, checkout, payment)
- Tools: Playwright, Cypress
```

**F.I.R.S.T. Principles:**
```
F - Fast: tests run quickly, encourage frequent execution
I - Independent: tests don't depend on each other or execution order
R - Repeatable: same result every time, in any environment
S - Self-Validating: pass or fail, no manual inspection needed
T - Timely: written before or with the code, not after
```

### Code Review Best Practices

```
What to Review:
- Correctness: does it solve the problem?
- Design: is the approach appropriate?
- Readability: can others understand it easily?
- Security: any vulnerabilities introduced?
- Performance: any obvious bottlenecks?
- Tests: adequate coverage for changes?

How to Review:
- Review in < 400 lines of code per session
- Be constructive, suggest alternatives
- Distinguish between blocking and nit-pick comments
- Automate what can be automated (lint, format, types)
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```
ARCHITECTURE:
- Big Ball of Mud: system without clear structure
- Distributed Monolith: worst of both worlds
- Golden Hammer: use same solution for everything
- Premature Optimization: optimize before measuring
- Resume Driven Development: choose tech for CV
- Accidental Complexity: complexity without business value

CODE:
- God Class/Object: class that does everything
- Spaghetti Code: impossible to follow flow
- Copy-Paste Programming: duplication without abstraction
- Magic Numbers/Strings: unexplained literals
- Deep Nesting: more than 3 levels
- Leaky Abstractions: implementation details leaking through interface
- Static Cling: hard coupling to static methods
- Primitive Obsession: using primitives instead of value objects
- Feature Envy: method uses data from another class more than its own
- Shotgun Surgery: one change requires modifications in many places

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Single Point of Failure
- Hardcoded Configurations
- No Monitoring/Alerting
- No Backup Strategy
- Credentials in Code
```

### Domain Modeling Techniques

```
Event Storming:
- Workshop technique for domain discovery
- Orange sticky notes = Domain Events (past tense)
- Blue sticky notes = Commands (actions that trigger events)
- Yellow sticky notes = Actors/Users
- Pink sticky notes = External Systems
- Purple sticky notes = Policies (reactive logic)
- Result: bounded contexts, aggregates, event flows

Event Modeling:
- Visual blueprint of the entire system
- Timeline of events from left to right
- Shows: commands -> events -> read models
- Four patterns: entry, automation, translation, view

Domain Storytelling:
- Pictographic language for domain narratives
- Actors, work objects, activities
- Sequential numbering of interactions
- Great for discovering ubiquitous language

C4 Model (Diagrams):
- Context: system + external actors
- Container: applications, databases, queues
- Component: modules within a container
- Code: classes and interfaces (optional)

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD):
- Entities, attributes, relationships
- Cardinalities (1:1, 1:N, N:N)
- Essential for database design
```

## PILLAR 9: MODULARIZATION & FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

### React / Next.js Architecture

```
Feature-Based Folder Structure (recommended):
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── (auth)/            # Route groups for layouts
│   ├── (dashboard)/
│   └── api/               # API routes
├── features/              # Feature modules (core of the app)
│   ├── auth/

│   └── constants/        # Global constants
└── styles/               # Global styles
```

**Component Architecture:**
```
Component Hierarchy:
1. Pages (app/): route entry points, data fetching (Server Components)
2. Features (features/): business logic, stateful components
3. Shared Components (shared/): reusable, business-agnostic

Rules:
- Features can import from shared/, NEVER from other features
- Shared components are generic, no business logic
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Colocation: keep related files together in features
- One component per file, file name = component name
```

**State Management:**
```
Local State:
- useState/useReducer for component state
- Form state: React Hook Form + Zod

Server State:
- Next.js Server Components (preferred for Next.js)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for client-side data fetching
- SWR for simple cases
- NEVER manually sync server state with client state

Global Client State:
- Zustand: simple, minimal boilerplate (recommended)
- Jotai: atomic state management
- Context API: for small, rarely-changing state (theme, locale)
- AVOID Redux unless complex state machines are needed

URL State:
- nuqs or next-usequerystate for search params
- Use URL as single source of truth for filters, pagination, sorting
```

**Server Components vs Client Components (Next.js):**
```
Server Components (default):
- Render on server, zero JS sent to client
- Direct database/API access
- Use for: data fetching, static content, layouts
- Can import Client Components

Client Components ('use client'):
- Render on client, interactive
- useState, useEffect, event handlers
- Use for: interactivity, browser APIs, third-party client libs
- CANNOT import Server Components (pass as children)

Pattern: Server Component fetches data, passes to Client Component as props
```

### Monorepo Architecture

```
Monorepo Structure (Turborepo recommended):
monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/               # Main Next.js app
│   ├── admin/             # Admin dashboard
│   ├── mobile/            # React Native app
│   └── docs/              # Documentation site
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                # Shared component library
│   ├── database/          # Prisma schema + client
│   ├── auth/              # Shared auth logic
│   ├── email/             # Email templates + sending
│   ├── config-eslint/     # Shared ESLint config
│   ├── config-typescript/ # Shared TS config
│   └── utils/             # Shared utilities
├── turbo.json             # Turborepo pipeline config
├── package.json           # Root workspace config
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml    # pnpm workspaces

Tools:
- Turborepo: build system, caching, task orchestration
- pnpm workspaces: dependency management
- Changesets: versioning and changelogs

Rules:
- packages/ are LIBRARIES (no app-specific logic)
- apps/ are APPLICATIONS (can depend on packages)
- Shared packages have clear, minimal APIs
- Each package has its own tsconfig, eslint config
- Remote caching for CI speed (Vercel Remote Cache)
```

### Module Boundaries & Dependency Rules

```
Dependency Direction:
app/ -> features/ -> shared/ -> packages/

NEVER:
- Feature importing from another feature directly
- Shared importing from features
- Circular dependencies between modules

Communication Between Features:
- Via shared state (Zustand store)
- Via URL state (query params)
- Via events (custom events or event emitter)
- Via parent component props (composition)

Barrel Exports (index.ts):
- Each feature/module exports only its public API
- Internal implementation is private
- Makes refactoring safe within module boundaries
- Example: features/auth/index.ts exports only AuthForm, useAuth, etc.
```

### Performance Patterns (Frontend)

```
Code Splitting:
- Dynamic imports: next/dynamic or React.lazy
- Route-based splitting (automatic in Next.js)
- Component-based splitting for heavy components

Rendering Strategies (Next.js):
- SSG (Static Site Generation): build-time rendering, CDN cached
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering): request-time rendering
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration): SSG + revalidation
- PPR (Partial Prerendering): static shell + dynamic holes
- Streaming: progressive rendering with Suspense

Image Optimization:
- next/image for automatic optimization
- WebP/AVIF formats, responsive sizes
- Lazy loading below-the-fold images
- Blur placeholder for perceived performance

Bundle Optimization:
- Analyze with @next/bundle-analyzer
- Tree shaking: use named imports
- Avoid barrel file re-exports for large libraries
- External heavy dependencies (dayjs over moment)
```

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

When receiving any software task, this skill automatically applies:

1. **Clean Code Analysis:** Does the code follow clean code principles? Meaningful names? Small functions? Low complexity?

2. **Design Principles Check:** SOLID compliance? Correct application of DRY/KISS/YAGNI? Proper separation of concerns?

3. **Pattern Selection:** Appropriate design patterns for the problem? Not over-engineered? Not under-designed?

4. **Architecture Evaluation:** Adequate architectural style for the context? Well-defined boundaries? Correct communication patterns?

5. **DDD Alignment:** Are bounded contexts identified? Aggregates correctly defined? Ubiquitous language in use?

6. **System Design Review:** Scalable? Resilient? Available? Correct data storage? Appropriate caching?

7. **Security Assessment:** Authentication/authorization correct? Input validation? Secrets management? OWASP top 10 addressed?

8. **Testing Strategy:** Adequate test coverage? Right types of tests? F.I.R.S.T. principles followed?

9. **Modularization Check:** Feature boundaries clear? Dependency rules respected? Component architecture sound?

10. **Clear Communication:** Document decisions with justifications and trade-offs via ADRs when appropriate

## DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR MVPs & SaaS

```
Starting a new MVP/Micro-SaaS:

Architecture: Modular Monolith or Serverless (Next.js + Vercel)
Database: PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase) or PlanetScale
ORM: Prisma or Drizzle
Auth: Clerk or NextAuth.js
Payments: Stripe
Email: Resend
Queue: Inngest or BullMQ (if needed)
Cache: Upstash Redis (if needed)
Monitoring: Vercel Analytics + Sentry
CI/CD: GitHub Actions + Vercel auto-deploy

Scale Evolution Path:
1. MVP: Next.js monolith on Vercel
2. Growth: Add caching, optimize queries, background jobs
3. Scale: Extract hot paths to separate services
4. Enterprise: Microservices (only if truly needed)

NEVER over-architect an MVP. Ship fast, iterate based on real data.
BUT: maintain clean boundaries so scaling is possible later.
```

## CODE STYLE RULES

### General Principles

- **Early return pattern**: Always use early returns instead of nested conditions
- Avoid duplication through reusable functions and modules
- Decompose long components/functions (>80 lines) into smaller units
- Files with more than 200 lines should be split
- Prefer arrow functions when possible
- Use TypeScript strict mode always
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`

### Library-First Approach

- **ALWAYS search for existing solutions before custom code**
- Evaluate npm libraries, SaaS services, third-party APIs
- Custom code only for: unique business logic, performance-critical paths, special security requirements

### Code Quality

- Error handling with typed catch blocks
- Maximum 3 levels of nesting
- Focused functions, less than 50 lines when possible
- Focused files, less than 200 lines when possible
- Use Zod for runtime validation at boundaries
- Prefer composition and hooks over inheritance
